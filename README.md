<pre>This doesn't completely work at the moment.

This project is to help display, tag and filter images on a server.

What it will do:
    Shows you all the images in the current directory and lets you apply tags to them.
    Lets you change the view to see certain tags.
    Provide an interface for operations on sets of images:
    Downloading sets of images
        Deleting sets of images
        Modifying tags for images
    Anything else I can think of doing

Dependancies:
